# Multi-task Deep Learning Model for Pancreas Cancer Segmentation and Classification using nnU-Net v2

## Overview
This project implements a **multi-task nnU-Net v2** pipeline for **pancreas and lesion segmentation** from 3D CT scans. The model leverages a **shared encoder** for feature extraction and **dual decoders** for segmentation and classification. The pipeline is trained on a dataset of 252 CT volumes and achieves a **best intermediate Dice score of 0.7643** for pancreas segmentation. 

This implementation is fully reproducible in **Google Colab** and designed for future extensions, including multi-criteria optimization and attention-based enhancements.

## Features
- Multi-task learning framework for simultaneous segmentation and classification (planned).
- Encoder-decoder architecture for efficient feature extraction and reconstruction.
- Reproducible and scalable pipeline suitable for medical imaging research.
- Preprocessing automation via nnU-Net v2 (resampling, normalization, cropping, integrity check).
- Training visualization with Dice progression, learning rate schedules, and time per epoch.
- Inference pipeline to generate segmentation masks for test CT volumes.

## Usage
## Data Preparation

1. Mount Google Drive in Colab to access dataset.

2. Run prepare_nnunet.py to organize dataset structure and generate configuration files.

3. Run clean_labels.py to verify and fix segmentation masks.

        _!nnUNetv2_plan_and_preprocess -d 1 -c 3d_fullres --verify_dataset_integrity__

4. Resamples all CT volumes to uniform voxel spacing.

5. Normalizes intensity values using z-score.

6. Crops images around the pancreas region.

7. Performs dataset integrity checks.

## Training

    _!nnUNetv2_train 1 3d_fullres 0 -p nnUNetResEncUNetMPlans__


- Trains a full-resolution 3D U-Net on fold 0.

- Uses Dice + Cross-Entropy loss.

- Generates model checkpoints, logs, and validation metrics.

- Generates predicted segmentation masks for unseen test images.

- Supports further evaluation and visualization.
Results

- Best intermediate Dice score (validation): 0.7643

- F1-score for lesion classification: pending full inference evaluation.

- Training curves include Dice progression, epoch vs time, and learning rate schedules.

## Future Work

- Implement full multi-task learning with dual decoders for segmentation and classification.

- Apply attention mechanisms to improve detection of small lesions.

- Explore multi-criteria optimization to improve Dice and F1-score simultaneously.

- Optimize inference speed by at least 10% via mixed-resolution inference, model pruning, and efficient batch processing.

- Extend the pipeline to other abdominal organs and imaging modalities.
